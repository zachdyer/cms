            I watch YouTube instead of tv and sometimes I watch other programmers talk about programming because I’m interested in programming. I love to solve problems and I have the ability to sit at my computer for hours and hours so programming comes natural to me. But I’m not saying programming is easy because it’s not. It’s just what I happen to do.
          </p>
          <p>So last week I was watching the TechLead he’s a YouTuber who talks about his life as a programmer and sometimes gives pretty good advice. And he was talking about Python and how he recommended people who are getting started with a computer language to learn it. Because it’s one of the most popular and used languages of major tech companies. And these companies would want to hire someone with experience in this type of language.</p>

          <p>It’s like every time I hear somebody on YouTube hype a computer language i stop everything I’m doing and make a command line program in said language I’ve almost never used before. I say almost because I’ve tinkered with almost everything but I never get too deep into it. But sometimes I start a project and I can’t get off it. I just keep thinking about and keep coding.</p>

          <p>And last weekend I started writing Python. And I didn’t even know what I was going to write. So I started out doing simple things. Like printing to the command line. Then I started getting user input. Like when Python asked me what my name was. And when I answered Python would remember it until the program ended. But the problem was Python couldn’t remember my name after I already told him. And it was getting very annoying always having to tell him my name again.</p>

          <p>So I told Python he needed to write it down. And I learned how to write files with Python. So Python wrote my name down but he couldn’t read the file. So I learned how to open a file and read the first line. It felt amazing knowing that I successfully taught Python to not only ask for my name but remember it as well. And even with this simple task I learned about variable scope. I learned how to make functions which for some reason are called “defs” in Python. I learned how to set null values using “None”. None. Null. Tomatoes tomotoes. Makes sense to me. I learned how to use conditionals and they didn’t even need curly braces. All they really needed was a colon. And my favorite thing is I don’t have to type semicolons. I like how the code looks clean because you have to format it with indents.</p>

          <p>But I didn’t stop there. Could I make a guess the number game? Python would have to know how to pick a random number. So I learned how to use the random module to get a number between 1 and 5. Then Python would ask you what number he is thinking of. And most of the time Python would win because the odds are in his favor 5 to 1. And Python would even track the score and then talk shit when you exit the game. But when you exit the game the program does not exit it takes you to the main menu.</p>

          <p>On the main menu you can either play the guessing game. Play a dice rolling game or talk to a health adviser. When you choose to play DiceRoller you go to another menu where you can play 1 player or 2 player. But 2 player is the player vs Python. First player mode is just rolling a six sided die. So the games literally have no strategic element it’s just like a casino slot machine. The player rolls a die and Python rolls a die. Whoever gets the highest number scores.</p>

          <p>Now you’re saying what the hell is the health adviser. The health adviser is Dr. Python. He will ask you your name and birth-date and then he’ll write it down. After he writes it down he will end the appointment and say he’s ran out of time. When you go back to him he will read your chart and call you by your name and figure out how old you are. Once he figures it out he makes fun of you for being old and says there is nothing he can do about old age. Then he will end the checkup and you will go back to the main menu were you can quit and Python taunts you for leaving.</p>
